#### Optimizing Java: A brief tour of the JVM

At Devoxx UK I gave a presentation on Optimizing Java and a brief tour of how the JVM works. 
This was similar to the talk given at the LJC in 2017.


### Docklands LJC
#### Sidecar Lightning Talk

At the Docklands LJC I gave a very brief introduction to what a Sidecar is and the advantages and disadvantages.
The slides can be found [here](/assets/slide-decks/sidecar.pdf)

### London Java Community
#### How the JVM Executes Java

When Java was released in 1995 it was slow, a reputation it has carried for many years... 
Today Java can give performance that is comparable to C++ and can emit instructions that are more optimal than code which is statically compiled. 
But how? This talk will take a tour of code and the journey through the JVM and the optimisations in between. 
Using practical examples, JVM flags and the Open Source JIT Watch we will explore what the JVM does in an adaptation of the classic Hello World program, 
you'll never look at Java in the same way again.

The video of there session is available [here](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/10565-how-the-jvm-executes-java#video)

### Docklands LJC
#### HotSpot Under the Hood and Microbenchmarking in Java

This talk will firstly attempt to persuade you that Microbenchmarking is not a good idea and in fact can lead to inaccurate 
assumptions and poor systems as a result. 
Despite this warning there will be times when it is necessary, particularly for API designers and writers.

The talk will introduce JMH and talk about how to use it and some of what is happening behind the scenes to make your 
benchmark as accurate as possible.

It is impossible to gain a good microbenchmarking result, so we will discuss some of the outputs from JMH and how 
they should be reasoned to attempt to avoid a poor assumption.

The video of this session is available [here](https://docklandsljc.uk/2016/06/hotspot-hood-microbenchmarking-java.html)

## 2014 

In 2014 I recorded a short video for Night Hackers that was filmed at Oracle. 
The background noise was a little annoying as they decided to use that time to clean away the plates...
