## Welcome 

I am a Java developer, architect and author. 
I first became interested in Java during my degree in Computer Science at the University of Warwick, 
and after graduating I became a member of the London Java Community. 
Community has remained central to my contributions, which include working on the design and testing of [JSR-310](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=310) 
Java 8s date time API and   serving on the Java Community Process Executive Committee for several years. 
I am a regular conference speaker and currently focus on building customer facing technology at Morgan Stanley. 
I spent four years teaching Java and C++ in various countries around the world.

Working with [Ben Evans](https://twitter.com/kittylyst) and [Chris Newland](https://www.chrisnewland.com) I c-authored a book titled Optimizing Java. 
The book is available to purchase on [O'Reilly](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920042983.do), 
read on [Safari Books](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/optimizing-java/9781492039259/) 
or [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Optimizing-Java-Techniques-Application-Performance/dp/1492025798/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1526027489&sr=8-1&keywords=optimizing+java).
