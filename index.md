## Welcome 

James (Jim) Gough is an executive director and developer at Morgan Stanley, where he’s focused on building customer-facing technology. 
A Java developer and author, Jim first became interested in Java during his degree program at the University of Warwick; after graduating, he became a member of the London Java Community.
