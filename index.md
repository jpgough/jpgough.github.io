## Welcome 

I am a Java developer, architect and author. 
I first became interested in Java during my degree in Computer Science at the University of Warwick, 
and after graduating I became a member of the London Java Community. 
Community has remained central to my contributions, which include working on the design and testing of JSR-310 and 
serving on the Java Community Process Executive Committee for several years. 
I am a regular conference speaker and currently focus on building customer facing technology at Morgan Stanley. 
I spent four years teaching Java and C++ in various countries around the world.
