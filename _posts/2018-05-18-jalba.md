Earlier this month I was lucky enough to attend [JAlba](http://jalba.scot), an [Open Spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference) 
conference hosted in Edinburgh.
If you haven't attended an Open Spaces conference before I can't recommend them enough.
They are very different to big hussel and bussel of a large scheduled conference (though these have their own appeal too).
At JAlba there were around 80 attendees, which meant the opportunity for more white boarding styles of sessions and discussions.
Apologies if any of this is inaccurate, it's mostly from memory so feel free to [PR](https://github.com/jpgough/jpgough.github.io/tree/master/_posts) 
any suggestions.

### Thursday

We started on the Thursday with two session slots, the sessions I attended were _"Does the Software Industry need a 
[Hippocratic Oath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocratic_Oath)?"_ and Java 9 modules in Jetty. 
The two topics could hardly be any different and the first really hit home a sense of responsibility for the software we write.
From my perspective it seemed quite tricky (and the group was quite big) to steer the conversation meaningfully, and I think that is fine.
The fact is that trying to outline morality and responsibility is broadly subjective and 30+ developers will all have a unique perspective.
There was certainly some useful exploration here in particular the idea that there is definitely room in the world for cheap, crappy code. 
For me that was the key separating factor, if you write suboptimal code and have been instructed to do so are you being unethical? 
This is where this argument dives from software more towards legal contract and responsibility and of course runs out of time.

The Jetty modules conversation was really interesting as it was looking at how to apply modules to an Open Source project.
Jetty is used by many projects and obviously has not had a module system in the past. 
This means that over time developers have used internal parts of the API and perhaps even applied some evil patches.
I hadn't really thought much about modules until this session and realise that I now need to play with the more.
Issues that were discussed included

* Where should the public interfaces go? Should interfaces have their own module?
* If an interface has it's own module, but the implementation requires configuration e.g. threads in a thread pool - do you then expose the class?
* When do you stop exposing things? When do you just end up back at the classpath?
* Do you upset people by removing compatibility?

It became an excellent architectural discussion of using modules and became an interesting theme for more social parts of the trip.

#### Social

The first of the [JAlba](http://jalba.scot) social activities was a walk around Edinburgh's old and new town. 
The weather on this day was perhaps the most typical of Scotland - cold, grey and a little wet. 
I am not one for walking tours in particular, mainly as I quickly loose interest. 
This part of the conference probably had most value in being an opportunity to walk around and chat technology and get to know people better.
In fact [Nick Ebbitt](https://twitter.com/nickebbitt) and I discussed the Jetty modules session from earlier at some length whilst wandering round Edinburgh. 

After the walking tour we went to [The Scotch Whisky Experience](https://www.scotchwhiskyexperience.co.uk) and got a theme park 
like ride in a barrel. 
It was here that I first met [Robert Scholte](https://twitter.com/rfscholte) in a whisky barrel! 
The tour itself was quite fun and we got to saw a large unopened whisky collection - I'm still not sure how I feel about that.

After a thirst was worked up we Nick, Rob and I stopped for a quick beer down in Grassmarket before dinner. 
During which the conversation about modules came up again and I was explaining to Robert my opinions on modules and versions.
In particular that versions belonged (in my opinion) in the build system, and ensuring binary version compatibility could be done via SNAPSHOTs.
After that short rant I found out what Robert does - which is to chair the Apache Maven project. 
This is the best part about Open Spaces, everyone is an attendee there are no presenters and who you're talking to could be 
anyone in the tech community.
Thankfully it seems like my view points were not too outrageous. 

### Friday

- Lambdas and performance
- Graal
- Jetty Internals

#### Social


Friday was the day for the boat tour, however I had decided that I wouldn't take the boat trip.
Instead I decided to follow the somewhat nautical theme and hack around in the hotel with Kubernetes and Docker.
Nick and I did some hacking and looked through Nick's awesome presentation on dismantling mocking. 
I finally managed to get my toy [birthday API](https://github.com/jpgough/birthday-api) project to work on Kubernetes.
More to come on that when I get chance to write it up. 

- whisky tasting and dinner
