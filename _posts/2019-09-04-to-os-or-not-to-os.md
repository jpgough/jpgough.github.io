## Introduction
Devoxx Belgium or JavaPolis is a conference I've always wanted to attend.
I remember listening to the Java Posse Podcast on the way back to Surrey on the commute back home, learning about Java and admiring the idea of a Java Conference. 
Fast forward 15 years or so and YES!!! I've been accepted to speak at Devoxx BE, finally after a few attempts in the past. 

But there's a catch - contrary to the CFP on the site you have to pay to present a quickie talk and attend the conference.
This wasn't known to me at the time and was an error on the site, otherwise I'd have looked at a different session type.
The result is I am being asked to find €575 to give this talk and participate in the rest of the conference and I'm trying to determine if it is worth attempting to raise the funds. 

I feel that the talk is an important question to ask around Java and Open Source in general to support our Ecosystem. 

## Benefits of Working on Open Source

### Description 

Many developers like the idea of contributing to Open Source and almost all developers are using Open Source technologies. 
Many projects like Maven rely on the contributions from developers working in their free time and are important to the stability of the Java Ecosystem.

But what’s in it for me? Why should I get involved and what are the benefits from my contributions? 
Jim and Robert will present experiences from a variety of different projects such as Apache Maven, working with the JCP and contributing to Java itself. 

If you are thinking about exploring Open Source or wondering how to get involved this is the session for you. 

### Elevator Pitch

This talk is a balanced talk from the Apache Maven Chair and a Maven Contributor targeting becoming a Maven Committer. 
The discussion will draw on a wide range of experience from Apache, working to the JCP and forming the Adopt a JSR initiative that became Adopt Open JDK. 
Given the problems in the Java EE space and the changes in the way Java Releases operate the increase in Open Source participation across the Java Community at a grass roots level is more important now than ever before.
